python core syntax
-----------------
Let's get back to our elevator example and try out a way to become compliant with Python core syntax.

First, create a Person class without the magic method responsible for addition:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, weight, age, salary):
        self.weight = weight
        self.age = age
        self.salary = salary
p1 = Person(30, 40, 50)
p2 = Person(35, 45, 55)

print(p1 + p2)

The result of running the code is clear – Python doesn’t know how to perform addition on the two Person class objects.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "core#010.py", line 11, in 
    print(p1 + p2)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Person' and 'Person'
output

However, there’s a handy special purpose method, __add__(), which will fix the problem.

class Person:
    def __init__(self, weight, age, salary):
        self.weight = weight
        self.age = age
        self.salary = salary

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.weight + other.weight

p1 = Person(30, 40, 50)
p2 = Person(35, 45, 55)

print(p1 + p2)
output: 65
